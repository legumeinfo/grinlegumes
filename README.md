# grinlegumes


GRIN Legumes: GRIN germplasm data served at LIS.  Collect germplasm passport and evaluation data and serve it through this drupal module at LIS.

#History:
The evaluation data was earlier served as separate modules for peanut and chickpea at LIS using a sqlite database within the module.  GRINLegumes is the replacement for that.  Now it is in a separate schema in postgres, lis_germplasm. This module is aimed to serve that data at LIS in various ways.
